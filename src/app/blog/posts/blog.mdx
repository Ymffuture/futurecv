## ‚úçÔ∏è Manage Posts

You can create, edit, and delete blog posts by adding, modifying, or removing `*.mdx` files in the `src/app/blog/posts` directory.

## üìÑ Frontmatter

Frontmatter sets the metadata for each blog post ‚Äî including **title**, **description**, **image**, and **tags**. These properties power the SEO, open graph tags, and UI presentation.

<CodeBlock
    marginBottom="16"
    codeInstances={[
      {
        code:

summary: "A deep dive into building scalable fullstack apps with React, MongoDB, and Express."
tag: "ReactJS"
---`,
        language: "tsx",
        label: "src/app/blog/posts/react-mongodb.mdx"
      }
    ]}
/>

## ‚ö° MDX Syntax

Write content using **MDX**, which lets you blend Markdown with React components. Your content is transformed with **Once UI** components for rich styling and enhanced UX.

## üß© Custom Components

To use custom components inside blog posts, import them inside the `src/components/mdx.tsx` file.

<CodeBlock
    marginBottom="16"
    highlight="11-12"
    codeInstances={[
      {
        code:
`const components = {
    p: createParagraph as any,
    h1: createHeading(1) as any,
    h2: createHeading(2) as any,
    h3: createHeading(3) as any,
    h4: createHeading(4) as any,
    h5: createHeading(5) as any,
    h6: createHeading(6) as any,
    img: createImage as any,
    a: CustomLink as any,
    Table,
    CodeBlock,
};`,
        language: "tsx",
        label: "src/components/mdx.tsx"
      }
    ]}
/>

## üöÄ Hot Reload

MDX files do **not currently support hot reloading**, but a restart of the dev server reflects changes instantly. Future support is in progress.
